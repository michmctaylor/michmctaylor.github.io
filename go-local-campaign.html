        <h2>Go Local Campaign</h2>
        <p>The Go Local campaign is a series of print advertisements meant to build awareness for supporting local farmers rather than large commercial grocers. Sponsored by REAP Food Group, a non-profit organization, the ad campaign supports the idea of shortening the distance from farm to table.</p>
        <p>To create a series of print advertisements that will help persuade viewers in a non-aggressive way. While many social awareness campaigns are often designed to play on the viewers’ emotions and vulnerabilities, this campaign will not. It should have a positive voice while still being assertive. The target market of this campaign spans from young adults to elderly adults. Environmental responsiveness is a popular societal trend right now and this campaign should fit into that market.</p>
        <p>The advertisements were designed to be used either as print ads in a magazine or as larger poster sized ads. The fruit and vegetables are given a voice and it is as if the produce is speaking to the consumer. The type made up of different sets of hand drawn letters while still remaining cohesive with each other. One word on each ad is emphasized in a separate hand drawn script that relates to the quality or proximity of the produce. This emphasized word acts as a type of ‘buzz word’ for the viewer to quickly be able to understand the concept. Each of the phrases is a double entendre, where one of the meanings directly relates to the state of the produce (whether it be referring to the condition of the produce or it’s environment), and the second gives a playful or flirty impression. The bottom of the ads contain a short explanation and a call to action, directing the viewer to visit REAP’s website for more information.</p>
